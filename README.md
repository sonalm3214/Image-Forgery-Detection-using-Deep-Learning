#  🖼️Image Forgery Detection using CNN
This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect splicing forgeries in images. By utilizing **Error Level Analysis (ELA)** for feature extraction and a CNN-based classifier optimized with focal loss, the model effectively identifies manipulated images. It is designed for forensic applications, ensuring reliable detection of image tampering through robust evaluation metrics.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

This model uses transfer learning with a **VGG19** backbone, pretrained on ImageNet, to extract features from images. The final classification layers are customized for splicing forgery detection.

- **Feature Extraction**: Uses Error Level Analysis (ELA) to highlight manipulated regions.
- **Pretrained Backbone**: VGG19 (transfer learning from ImageNet).
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Batch normalization and dropout (0.5) for regularization.
- **Optimizer**: Adam for stable training.
- **Loss Function**: Focal Loss to handle class imbalance.

## 📊 Results & Evaluation  

The model was evaluated on the **test set**, achieving the following performance:  

| Metric         | Score  |
|---------------|--------|
| **Accuracy**  | **96.20%** |
| **Precision** | **89.00%** |
| **Recall**    | **89.42%** |
| **F1-Score**  | **89.21%** |

### 📌 Confusion Matrix  
The confusion matrix helps in understanding model performance in terms of True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True Negatives (TN), and False Negatives (FN):
| Actual \ Predicted | ✅0 (Authentic) | ❌1 (Tampered) |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **0 (Authentic)** |🟢 952           | 🔴24           |
| **1 (Tampered)**  |🔴 16           | 🟢192           |

- **🟢True Negative (TN)**: Authentic image correctly classified as authentic.  
- **🔴False Positive (FP)**: Authentic image misclassified as tampered.  
- **🔴False Negative (FN)**: Tampered image misclassified as authentic.  
- **🟢True Positive (TP)**: Tampered image correctly classified as tampered.
